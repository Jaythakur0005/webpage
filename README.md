# ConsulTOpen

Hey there ðŸ‘‹

This is a simple frontend project I built called **ConsulTOpen**. Itâ€™s a website for student consultation services, covering mental health support, career guidance, and internship help. I made it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€” with a bit of Bootstrap and Font Awesome thrown in to make it look better.

Not my first frontend project, but still learning and trying to improve with every build.

## What it does

- Clean homepage with hero section and smooth navigation
- Scroll animations and a scroll-to-top button
- 3 service cards (mental health, career, internship)
- Responsive layout (mostly works well on smaller screens too)
- A contact form with basic validation (no backend yet)

---

## Tech used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (vanilla)

---

## File structure

- `index.html` â†’ main page structure
- `style.css` â†’ all the custom styles
- `script.js` â†’ handles scroll, animations, and form validation

---

## Things I want to add (later maybe)

- Connect the form to an actual backend (probably using Formspree or something similar)
- Dark mode toggle
- Better mobile responsiveness
- Maybe a blog or FAQ section too

---

## How to run

Just clone/download the repo and open `index.html` in your browser. Thatâ€™s it â€” no server needed.

## Final thoughts

This was a fun project to work on and helped me practice things like smooth scrolling, animations, and form validation with vanilla JS. If you have any feedback or suggestions, feel free to reach out. Iâ€™m always open to learning more.

Thanks for reading! ðŸ™‚
